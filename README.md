# Kingdom
A simple artificial intelligence game I designed in Unity and C#. Objective of the game is to watch how computer controlled characters interact with each other and make decisions. As of right now, current controls that the chracters can do are movements and actions such as:
-Random terrian exploration based on enviroment analysis
-Fighting eachother based off of pre-randomly generated combat stats
-Resource gathering 
-Crafting of certain buildings and farms based off of resources (Iron mines and wood farms)

The world that the simulation takes place in is random generated and currently includes:
-Rivers
-Mountains
-Multiple tree types (pine, maple)
-Rocks
